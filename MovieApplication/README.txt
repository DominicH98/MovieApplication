To run the application, find the Visual Studio Solution file titled
"MovieApplication.sln" in the file once found
open this file in Visual Studio.

The solution should open containing the MovieApplication and the
MovieDatabase.

To make sure that the database exists and can connected to, the project will
need to be ran and deployed inside the solution.
Once this is done, the MovieApplication will be able to be run and the
Web Application should open in your browser.

The application is a small CRUD application written in ASP.NET MVC (C#) with React used for the front end.
The applciation is based around "Movies" that can be added to an sql database, then edited and deleted at future points.

Please note
This application is my first experience using React or Javascript in a project or for development purposes.
